Generally Travel Agencies are slow and not that efficient because of the improper use of data structures and algorithms. 
●	As data is calculated with the use of graph and Djikstra’s algorithm to calculate the distance which is stored in different files so the chances of incorrect output are negligible.
LIST OF CONCEPTS AND ALGORITHM USED:
DJIKSTRA’S ALGORITHM
GREEDY APPROACH
GRAPH THEORY 
PRIORITY QUEUE
DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
This project provided me with experience which will help us in future we came to know that how we can implement Djikstra’s algorithm in real life problems. I have taken multiple cities the distance between which I have calculated using this approach and stored the data using dynamic programming approach. Some important things which I have learned include designing a good program architecture and converting real life situations into an efficient code and how to write an good looking easily readable and understandable as well as time and memory efficient code.
